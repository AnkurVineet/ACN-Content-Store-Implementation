Content Store Algorithm Implementation and Optimization for Caching in Named Defined Networks
======
Proposed use of no cache and near cache policy in which the 
similar performance can be obtained by having cache enabled
in very few nodes as compared to using caching in all the
nodes. Also implemented more number of cache
replacement policy in new content store implementation.
